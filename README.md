👋 Hi there! I'm Phuoc Nguyen

🔭 I’m currently working as a Frontend Developer, building scalable web applications using React.js, SWR, React Hook Form, and Material UI.

🌱 I’m currently learning Golang and the Gin Gonic framework to strengthen my backend skills.

💡 I’ve also worked with .NET, Angular, and Flutter, and I enjoy exploring different stacks to understand how everything connects.

🐍 I know my way around Python and Pandas for data manipulation and automation tasks.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on modern web or cross-platform projects, especially those involving React, Go, or Flutter.

🤔 I’m looking for help with improving CI/CD pipelines and achieving faster, high-quality release cycles.

💬 Ask me about frontend architecture, form handling, clean code, or tech stack design decisions.

📫 How to reach me: thanhphuocb7@gmail.com

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I love learning new frameworks just to see how they solve old problems differently — and I often end up mixing the best parts together!
